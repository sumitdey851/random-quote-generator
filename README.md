# random-quote-generator
### Description:
This app makes a request to an API that returns a list of famous quotes.
That list is saved to an array and then a quote is randomly selected from it.
This quote is then displayed on the UI. 
The UI has a quote section, an author section and two buttons;
the social media twitter button uses [Twitterâ€™s Web Intent API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/tweet-button/guides/web-intent)
to create a post with the current quote as the post body
and lets a user who is logged in to tweet the quote.
The second button requests a new random quote.
This project was made using plain old _JavaScript, HTML and CSS_.
It uses [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for the fonts and the background pattern is from
[Hero Patterns | Free repeatable SVG background patterns for your web projects](https://www.heropatterns.com/). 
The app is mobile responsive.
